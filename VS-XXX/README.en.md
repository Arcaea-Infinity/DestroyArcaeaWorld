# VS-???

And now, instincts begin to lurch, old and forgotten, in the wake of those thoughts.

They haven’t yet taken hold, those discarded yet practical sensibilities. They have only stirred. She is still afraid. She clings to hope by a little finger.

Somehow, she manages to pull on ten Bots to aid her, striking out the needle-encryption that had been keeping her in the sky

Ingloriously she drops to the now-deformed ground, her chosen Bots afterward hovering over her crumpled, aching body. Oddly enough, she finds herself smiling now, too.

She pushes herself up with her left hand. For all the enmity evident in Guy’s assault, she had taken too much pleasure in 'No One Cares', rather than inflicting any sort of mortal blow.

Even the shard now in Taikari’s chest, so near to her beating heart and flickering with horrid, wrathful flame, did not do the deed.

Maybe it was intended to. Regardless, Taikari is still alive.

She feebly sends forth an attack, which is quickly swatted down by the girl flying above her. Among the company owners Taikari has heard of, there is absolutely no boss as terrible as Guy.

A veritable dark queen, ruling night in a world of day. That ecstatic, yet obviously empty smile...

Seeing this, Taikari can feel it: how her own feelings are beginning to slip away.

Stark reality is sobering her more and more, and rather than dread it, as she had been only minutes—no, seconds ago, she begins instead to register each fact present to the situation.

Slowly—or, as slowly as Guy will allow. His encryptions never stop during the update.

Shifting her body left and right, guarding her weakest areas with what few memories remain to her, Taikari examines their field of battle.

It has been torn asunder, and now looks more a wasteland than ever before. Ripped, ruined all through, there is only B30 left everywhere. The Bots around them is uncountable. The power Guy has is immeasurable.

Taikari herself is weak. Not only in terms of strange abilities and control over Bots—her body has been run ragged. She doesn’t have much left before she falls from weariness alone.
